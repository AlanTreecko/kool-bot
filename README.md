# kool-bot
A quick and dirty discord.js bot.

## install guide
You will need to install Python, discord.js, and a crap ton of other shit for it to work.

You will need to also put your bot's token into the script.

Afterwards, run the bot by sending `py -3 bot.py` into CMD in the same directory as the script.
